- Quality of theory is related to how good measurement is and if the theory is good but measurement is bad theory will be incorrectly updated
- Measurement is more than questionnaires  but the focus of this session is questionnaires
- Focus will be on transparency in measurement process. pre-registration is difficult as the decisions are very iterative. Have to make measurement decisions that you don’t know you will have to make
	- So declare decisions are you make them. Each instrument as unforeseen decisons that need to be made post-hoc
- In JPSP 700 measures in 35 articles and most were item based scales. 30% of those were one item scales
	- 40% of measures not cited
	- 19% were modified/adapted
	- Not uncommon to not find a scale development paper.
	- Precedent scales are scales with no shown validity but the scale has become widely used
	- Majority of scales only have reliability (alpha)
	- 18% will have no other information
	- 21% will report more, i.e. factor analysis
- Chronbach’s alpha assumes scale is uni-deminsional, it does not show uni-dimensionality
	- is often used to signal validity in studies where no validation study is cited
-  Measurement variability makes replication studies hard to interpret
- In replication studies we are interesting in the validity of findings and conclusions
	- measurement is a low level decision which influences the statistics which influences the conclusions
- QRP is exploiting ambiguity to get the result you want
	- the asks you to question intention of the intentions of the researcher
	- perhaps better to say questionable reporting practices, which removes the intention aspect of the judgement
- Flake & Fried take questionable reporting practices approach. Accepts we do not know the intention of the researcher, can easliy be unintentional

## Questionable Measurement Practices (QMP)
- decision a researcher make that leave questions about the measurement practices in the study
- QMPs lack justification and transparency
	- It’s ok to say we made it up on the fly, we did it for this reasons and call it a limitation
- QMP is not evidence for p-hacking, it just means we do not know how decisions were made
- QMPs make it very hard to reproduce and replicate a study
- Hans IJzerman has detailed study measurement and pre-reg stuff on his (OSF)[https://osf.io/3hsfj/] page
- Garden of forking measurement paths in which different measurement decisions will lead to changes in inferential test results
