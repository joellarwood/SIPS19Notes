## Introduction 
- Can do empirical and non-empirical theory assesment 
- Measurement of science 

### Objectivity 
- Objective as a desirable but perhaps non-obtainable goal of scince. Raises the question of what is the operation definition of objectivity
    - objecitivity as resisitance to bias and QRPs
    - This allows us to come up with robust methods, a research practice as robust as possible but perhaps still not value free 
 
### Replicability 
- An experiment as repeatable in the proper experimental conditions 
    - can be just knowing how to do an experiment or getting the same results 
- Can measure similairty 
- Types of replication 
    - exact replication
    - conceptual replication (shares just hypothesis but different methods) 
    - Others in between 
    - Disagreement as to which is best or most helpful to science
- Concpetual replicnation seen to give better theoretical support 
- Other people argue anything can fit into conceptual replication, so direct replication gives you a more robust faith in the experiment in question 
- What we can learn 
Exact replication | Conceptual replication
--------------------------------------------
If it fails we can question the study but could be type one error | If it fails could be type 1 error in the first study but could also be differences in method
If it is succesful we help to elimiate type 1 error explination | If succesful it shows hypothesis are supported independet in of the original study 
Is a cheaper and easier way to do things | Easier to get conceptual replication 
Easier pre-registration | Don't need to know exactly how original experiment was conducted 
Very hard to get an exact replication | evidence from two expirmental sources than one
Where does something not become a direct replication | Usually presented as new research, sans pre-registration
Will repeat biases in original study | Costly, need a new design
