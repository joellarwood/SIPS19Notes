## Introduction 
- Can do empirical and non-empirical theory assesment 
- Measurement of science 

### Objectivity 
- Objective as a desirable but perhaps non-obtainable goal of scince. Raises the question of what is the operation definition of objectivity
    - objecitivity as resisitance to bias and QRPs
    - This allows us to come up with robust methods, a research practice as robust as possible but perhaps still not value free 
 
### Replicability 
- An experiment as repeatable in the proper experimental conditions 
    - can be just knowing how to do an experiment or getting the same results 
- Can measure similairty 
- Types of replication 
    - exact replication
    - conceptual replication (shares just hypothesis but different methods) 
    - Others in between 
    - Disagreement as to which is best or most helpful to science
- Concpetual replicnation seen to give better theoretical support 
- Other people argue anything can fit into conceptual replication, so direct replication gives you a more robust faith in the experiment in question 
- What we can learn 

Exact replication | Conceptual replication
------------------- | -------------------------
If it fails we can question the study but could be type one error | If it fails could be type 1 error in the first study but could also be differences in method|
If it is succesful we help to elimiate type 1 error explination | If succesful it shows hypothesis are supported independet in of the original study 
Is a cheaper and easier way to do things | Easier to get conceptual replication 
Easier pre-registration | Don't need to know exactly how original experiment was conducted 
Very hard to get an exact replication | evidence from two expirmental sources than one
Where does something not become a direct replication | Usually presented as new research, sans pre-registration
Will repeat biases in original study | Costly, need a new design 

### What replication do we choose?

## Statistics and Inference 
- What are better ways to make inferences from statisticas and data 
- Bringing inference closer to scientific process 

### Threee big questions in Phil of Stat 
1. What I beleive (or what are my priors, subjective degress of beleif in hypothesis). Applicible to Bayesian 
2. What should we do 
    - Statistical decision theory 
    - Neyman-Pearson, Wald, and Savage. If you use subjective beleifs/Bayes will be using Savage appraoch 
3. What is the evidence for the scientific claim 
    - P value and Bayes Factors 

### What is the evidence for a claim 
#### P values
- p value gives the probablity of obsserving the data or something more extreme given the null hypothesis 
- Different to likelihood of the hypothesis given the data 
- Tea-lady testing
    - telling a change effect from a real effect 
    - Comes from Carl Popper and Fisher 
    - Example from Fisher: A person says they can tell if milk is poured into cup before or after the tea. We test the null that her performance is chance. If the number of succesful guesses in unexpected then it is either an extremely rare chance has occured or something other than the null-hypothesis is true 
- Looks at probably of what could have been observed to what was observed 
- P values have come under question as has the uses of significance threshold
- P values are not intuitive leading to fallacies in interpretation 
- Confidence values proposed as alternative but are still derived from Confidence Intervals 
- P value criticised as a signal noise relationship
- P values have lots of dependence on the data and the sampling plan

##### Bayes 
- How your beleif of the hypothesis being true changes according to the data 
- An agents subjective beleif of the Hypothesis 
- Allows measurement of evidence for or agsinst the null. The NHST only lets you measure against the null
- Bayes you need to specifiy beleif about the alternative. More effort than the thresholding of NHST 
    - Closest alternative in NHST is in equivilence testing. Has explicit reasoning about null.
- Bayes does not quantify effect as much as NHST, requires further testing(i.e. Estimator) Bayes factor does not give effect size   

### Questions in Philosphy of Science 
- Is it possible to find common ground 
- Optional stopping as affecting the results 
- Is Bayes v P dependent on question 
- How do statstical practices interact with researcher values (i.e. QRPs)
- What is the role of hypothesis testing in sciecne 

## Epistemology and Social Epistemology
- The big questions about knowledge 
- SE reacts to assumption that knowledge aquisition is an individual actii=vty 
    - SE says knowledge is a social activity 
- Two varities of SE 

### Individual Agents 
- Individual agents are faced with social evidence 
- Indiviusal has their own beliefs and asks querstion when do I change my beleifs based on the evidence from other agents. When is it rationale to change my personal beleifs? Who's information do I give weight to?
- there is the question about what to do with peer disagreement 

### Systems oritneted 
- Social ststem houses practices, proceedures, insitutions etc. 
- Core question is how does the organisation of the system affect the outcomes of the members. The organisation as determining what people are exploring 
- i.e. Which system produces less errors?

## Social Epistemology of Science 
- Knowledge sharing, peer revieiw, industry bias, reward systems and divisions of labour 

### Reward system of science 
- Why do scientists produce science?
- priority rule: The first scientist making a discovery gets prestige, the rest get nothing (Merton, 1957)
    - see battles of how found something first 
- Economics of sciecne characrterises scientiftc findings as public goods 
    - A public good is not used when consumed 
    - Is non-excludable 
    - An example is a lighthouse, everyone gets the light it produces can;t prevent that. Just as anyone experiences science (although there are caveats) 
- Scientists can't get the material goods but do get the right to be acknowledged and the prestige/position that comes with this 
- This system incentivises people do to science but can also be imparing 
- Optimistic perspective: Assumption that science is a succesful enterprise then goes on to say we can trace this to the reward system and efficient division of labelling. 
    - Testing through mathematical modelling 
    - If only interested in the truth work on the project that is most promising. If doing it for prestige will do things that others are not. 
    - Scientists are both truth and credit drive. So will chase something less promising for a bigger credit reward is succesful 
### How does this reward system relate to replicability?
- The emphasis on novelty andf priority is not beneficial to science 
- The priority rule rewards findings regardless of replicability 
- Priority is estsablished by peer-review but this does not ensure replicability 
- If peer review does not gaurentee repliciability who does?
    - is it the job of the original researcher or the community? Both lead to tension 
- The priority rule does not incentivse replication. No credit driven incentive

### Epistemic institution design 
- Goes back to Francis Bacon 
- Imagine you have power to change all social structures 
    - can ask about goal priorities =. i.e. correct literature or fewer but more robust findings 
- How would intervene? Science is dispersed
- How would you test the effecitveness of interventions
